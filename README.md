## üè† Homelabbing: Hands-On Learning

Transform your old laptop or Raspberry Pi into a powerful learning environment! Homelabbing is one of the best ways to gain practical experience with cloud technologies, DevOps tools, and system administration.

### Getting Started Resources

- **[Awesome Selfhosted](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted)** - Curated list of self-hosted applications
- **[Home Lab Beginners Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/wiki/beginnersguide)** - Comprehensive starter guide
- **[Raspberry Pi Projects](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/)** - Official Raspberry Pi project tutorials
- **[Proxmox VE](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-ve)** - Free virtualization platform for homelabs
- **[TrueNAS Scale](https://www.truenas.com/truenas-scale/)** - Open-source NAS OS with container and VM support
- **[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)** - Containerization platform perfect for homelab projects
- **[Kubernetes on Raspberry Pi](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/turnkey/on-premises/)** - Run Kubernetes clusters at home

### Popular Homelab Projects

- **Media Server**: Plex, Jellyfin, or Emby for streaming
- **Home Automation**: Home Assistant for smart home control
- **Monitoring**: Grafana + Prometheus for system monitoring
- **Backup Solutions**: Nextcloud for personal cloud storage
- **Development Environment**: GitLab, Jenkins, or GitHub Actions runners
- **Network Services**: Pi-hole for ad blocking, VPN servers
- **Personal Website**: Deploy a simple website on your homelab and expose it to the internet using Cloudflare Tunnels

### üåê Exposing Your Homelab to the Internet

One of the most exciting homelab projects is deploying your own website and making it accessible worldwide! Here's how to get started:

**Cloudflare Tunnels** provide a secure way to expose your homelab services to the internet without opening ports on your router or dealing with dynamic IP addresses. This is perfect for:

- **Personal portfolios** and project showcases
- **Learning web development** with real-world deployment
- **Understanding reverse proxies** and modern networking
- **Practicing DevOps** with CI/CD pipelines to your homelab

**Getting Started:**
1. Deploy a simple web server (nginx, Apache, or containerized app) on your homelab
2. Install Cloudflare Tunnel (`cloudflared`) on your homelab machine
3. Configure the tunnel to route traffic from your domain to your local service
4. Update your DNS records in Cloudflare to point to your tunnel

This approach teaches you about DNS, reverse proxies, SSL certificates, and modern web deployment practices - all essential skills for cloud engineering!

### üíª Hardware Recommendations

- **Raspberry Pi 4** (4GB+ RAM) - Great for learning Linux and containerization
- **Old Laptop/Desktop** - Perfect for running virtual machines and heavier workloads
- **Mini PC** (Intel NUC, Beelink) - Compact but powerful for homelab servers

## üåü Getting Involved with CNCF Open Source
