### [levels.fyi](https://levels.fyi)
A comprehensive platform for understanding tech industry compensation, career levels, and company insights. Essential for students to understand market rates and career progression in tech companies.

## üìñ Must-Read Articles

### [How to be a -10x Engineer](https://taylor.town/-10x)
A satirical but insightful article that highlights common anti-patterns in engineering teams. While humorous, it provides valuable lessons about what NOT to do as an engineer, helping students understand the importance of good engineering practices, clear communication, and effective teamwork.

## üéØ Key Takeaways

- **Continuous Learning**: The tech industry evolves rapidly - stay curious and keep learning
- **Soft Skills Matter**: Technical skills are important, but communication and collaboration are equally crucial
- **Career Paths**: There are multiple ways to grow in tech beyond traditional management tracks
- **Industry Awareness**: Understanding compensation, company culture, and market trends helps make informed career decisions
- **Best Practices**: Learn from both positive examples and common pitfalls to develop good engineering habits

## üè† Homelabbing: Hands-On Learning

Transform your old laptop or Raspberry Pi into a powerful learning environment! Homelabbing is one of the best ways to gain practical experience with cloud technologies, DevOps tools, and system administration.

### Getting Started Resources

- **[r/homelab](https://reddit.com/r/homelab)** - Reddit community with guides, project ideas, and troubleshooting help
- **[Awesome Selfhosted](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted)** - Curated list of self-hosted applications
- **[Home Lab Beginners Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/wiki/beginnersguide)** - Comprehensive starter guide
- **[Raspberry Pi Projects](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/)** - Official Raspberry Pi project tutorials
- **[Proxmox VE](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-ve)** - Free virtualization platform for homelabs
- **[TrueNAS Scale](https://www.truenas.com/truenas-scale/)** - Open-source NAS OS with container and VM support
- **[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)** - Containerization platform perfect for homelab projects
- **[Kubernetes on Raspberry Pi](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/turnkey/on-premises/)** - Run Kubernetes clusters at home

### Popular Homelab Projects

- **Media Server**: Plex, Jellyfin, or Emby for streaming
- **Home Automation**: Home Assistant for smart home control
